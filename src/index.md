Welcome this blog!

This blog serves as a simple showcase of μblog.

With μblog you can create very elegant, minimalistic blog sites, without the need
for large web frameworks. Out of the box, it doesn't include any javascript, but that
can easiely be added by the user, if desired.

The posts are written in Markdown, and converted to HTML, by utilizing pandoc under the hood.

For more information, you can find this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/766F6964/mublog).
